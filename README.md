Project Title: Bubble Chart Analysis of App Size and Rating for Games on Google Play Store

Project Overview:

This project aims to plot a bubble chart that visualizes the relationship between app size (in MB) and average rating, with the bubble size representing the number of installs. The focus of the analysis is on apps within the "Games" category that meet specific criteria related to size, installs, and ratings. The chart provides insights into the correlation between app size and user satisfaction, as reflected by the rating, while emphasizing the most popular games by using bubble size to represent install counts.

Key Filters Applied:

    App Category: Only include apps belonging to the "Games" category.
    Rating: Include only apps with an average rating higher than 3.5.
    Installs: Only include apps with more than 50,000 installs.

Additional Features:

    Bubble Size: Represents the number of installs, allowing easy identification of the most popular games.
    Filtered Display: The chart will be designed to function and update exclusively between 12 PM to 4 PM, providing a focused time window for analysis.

Deliverables:

    Bubble Chart: A visualization that shows the relationship between app size (MB) and average rating for games, with the size of each bubble indicating the number of installs.

Purpose:

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between the size of gaming apps and their ratings, offering valuable insights into how app size correlates with user satisfaction. The focus on games with high ratings and significant install counts ensures that only relevant, popular apps are considered in the analysis. By restricting the analysis to a specific time window (12 PM to 4 PM), the chart ensures that it captures relevant trends during this period.
